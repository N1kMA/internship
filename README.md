# internship
Provectus internship.
In Level1.py i use regex for file specification. If those files are csv, i read them and append to list.
Also if file is png I append that information to list.
After all, whole data was appended to pandas dataframe.

Well, Level2 and Level 3 is the same, but in the Level3 i use modified Level1.py - Level1_1.py,
because I need to write data to database, instead of local file system.

Execution time was optimized with pandas hel again :)
Logic is simple: i need to know how much symbols in those lists.
And pandas give me that info, after that all i need to know is which symbol in both of those lists.
I use inner join for that. After all i need just to multiply those values.

Distinct symbols - i use only my logic, and i think there is a better solution)

Linux tasks - honestly, in Linux CLI i know only this commands: ls, cat and nano)
All questions was googled)
